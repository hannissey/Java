Chapter 10 Introducing JavaFX
Self-Test Questions

1. Briefly describe the history of graphics programming in Java.

Java's initial way of programming graphics was AWT - Abstract Window Tool.
It wasn't very successful however because it was a heavyweight tool that relied on the OS to
style the graphics. It was replaced by Swing in 2000, which in turn was replaced with JavaFX with the
release of Java8 in 2014.

2. What is the name of the three methods that are called when a JavaFX application
is launched? what is the purpose of each?

    void init()                         This runs any code that has to run before the application.

    abstract void start(Stage stage)    This runs the application.

    void stop()                         This runs code required to run after the application.

3. Which containers have been used in the following two scene graphics?
    (a) GridPane
    (b) StackPane

4. Describe how the following containers lay out the nodes that they contain:
    (a) a VBox          This lays out nodes vertically.
    (b) an HBox         This lays out nodes horizontally.
    (e) a FlowPane      This arranges nodes in a row. It is responsive, and changes with window resizing.
    (f) a BorderPane    This creates 5 'regions' within the window where nodes can be placed.
    (c) a GridPane      This arranges nodes in a grid, using rows and columns.
    (d) a StackPane     This 'stacks' nodes one on top of the other.
